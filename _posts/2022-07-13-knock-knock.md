I thought it was a good idea to make my first post here into a quick statement into what exactly I am doing with this site. From personal experience, asking the *Five W's* always yields good results.

## What?

This is just another in a myriad of pages hosted on lovely Github. The only difference is that this one contains my personal thoughts and contributions, hope you enjoy it.

## Why?

The only thing I am seeking from this site is to put good things out there. More often than not I'll spend a considerable amount of time working on a particular problem, arrive at a solution, and then leave it at that. Wouldn't it be nice if I also shared that?

## Who?

You can find more at my [about page](/about/). In short, I'm an IT professional with over 14 years of experience as of the writing of this post in several areas including cloud networking and infrastructure, security, programming, and devops. I am also an avid music lover, dabble in cooking, and live for exploring.

## When?

There is absolutely no way I can keep up putting new material out there with any sort of reasonable frequency. I'll update it when I can and have something new and cool to share.

## Where?

[Right here!](https://www.rafaelsampaio.net)

# TL;DR

It's another blog, a lot of tech stuff, sometimes personal things too. Hope you enjoy it.
